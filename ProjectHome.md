This project is designed to create a general purpose toolkit to support research on auditory perception.  Although our primary goal is to better understand the musical experience, we are also interested in exploring general issues of auditory perception and cognition.  To this end, we will focus on several veins of research:

  1. Sensory integration
  1. Rhythm/timing
  1. The communication of emotion through sound
