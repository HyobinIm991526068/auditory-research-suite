# Python3 implementation of the Auditory Research Suite

## Specifics of the python 3 version

### Output file
Output is saved to a .csv file with the same name and in the same folder as the properties file

### Properties files
Properties files must contain all of the properties defined in the example files (see the Example Properties folder in the module directory).

When loading from the data directory, the first properties file found will be the one used, so make sure that it contains only the file that you want to run

# New properties

## General

### usePlaylist (true/false)
Enables the playlist based trial loading system, where the list of trials for each block is loaded from a CSV file in the data directory. 

### playlistName (string)
sets the name of the playlist file to be loaded or created if usePlaylist is enabled. 

### loadTrialsFromFolder (true/false)
If set to true, blocks will be created by iterating over all files in the respective folders for each block. Otherwise, the older parameter based block building system will be used.
If usePlayist is enabled and no playlist file exists, this sets the method that will be used to build the playlist file.

## si.properties

### duration.label (string)
defines the text that will appear above the topmost slider on the SI interface

### agreement.label (string)
defines the text that will appear above the bottommost slider on the SI interface

### postStimulusSilence (int)
defines the length of the delay in milliseconds after the stimulus has been shown

# Modified properties

All text properties must now be on one line. They can still use HTML tags as required.
showTickMarks in si.properties has been modified from a bool to an integer, where the value set dictates the distance between each tick, and disables ticks when set to 0
