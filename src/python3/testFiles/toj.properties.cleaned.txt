introScreenTitle=Introduction
introScreenText=<html><p>Welcome! Thank you for participating in this experiment. <br><br> In this simple experiment, you will be presented with a tone through the headphones you are wearing, and a white dot that will appear in the middle of a fixation cross on the screen. Your task will be to indicate whether the tone or the dot came first. As well, we will ask you to rate your confidence. Do not be fooled - this might be harder than it seems! <br><br>Good luck! </p> <p>Please click the <b>Next</b> button to continue.
